I'm currently a senior at Rutgers University, studying Computer Science, Anthropology, and Art History.

I also develop their official <a href="https://github.com/rutgersmobile/android-client">Android app</a> at <a href="http://oss.rutgers.edu">Rutgers Open System Solutions</a>, a team of student programmers who develop and deploy open-source software for the university.

Many of the photos you'll find in the background were taken during my summer abroad in 2013, while I was attending the <a href="http://www.ncas.rutgers.edu/upper-sabina-tiberina-archaeological-field-school-0">Rutgers archaeological field school in Italy</a>.


The theme I'm using for this Jekyll blog is [Thinny](https://github.com/camporez/Thinny).
